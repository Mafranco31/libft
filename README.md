# Libft

Libft is the first project of the school 42 where we learn how to create our library and create the commun function that we will use all our cursus.

## Description

In this project we build function that we will use in every project after, and not even in C language :\n
	- character modifing function like tolower & toupper\n
	- character format function like isalnum, isalpha, isascii, isdigit, isprint\n
	- parsing function like atoi and itoa that change the type of the variable\n
	- string analysing function like strchr, strlen, strncmp, strnstr\n
	- string modifying function like strdup, striteri, strjoin, strlcat, substr\n
	- the split function that split a string into a table of strings\n
	- function to write in a file descriptor\n
	- list managing funcion\n

If you want more indication about these funcion, type man <function name>

## Installation

$git clone "path" libft\n
$cd libft\n
