# Libft

Libft is the first project of the school 42 where we learn how to create our library and create the commun function that we will use all our cursus.

## Description

In this project we build function that we will use in every project after, and not even in C language :  
- character modifing function like [ft_tolower](./src/ft_tolower.c) & `ft_toupper.c`  
- character format function like isalnum, isalpha, isascii, isdigit, isprint  
- parsing function like atoi and itoa that change the type of the variable  
- string analysing function like strchr, strlen, strncmp, strnstr  
- string modifying function like strdup, striteri, strjoin, strlcat, substr  
- the split function that split a string into a table of strings  
- function to write in a file descriptor  
- list managing funcion  

If you want more indication about these funcion, type man <function name>

## Installation

$\>git clone "path" libft  
$\>cd libft  
$\>make  

now you can use libft function in your files (don't forget to include libft.h header in your files)
